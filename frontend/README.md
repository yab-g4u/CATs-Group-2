# Frontend starter (Patient History)

This folder contains a minimal Next.js + Tailwind starter scaffold to bootstrap the UI for the Patient History project.

Quick start (from repository root):

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:

- This is a UI scaffolding with stubbed services. Backend API routes are expected under `/api` in the main repository or a separate backend service.
- i18n is implemented as a tiny in-app provider using the JSON files in `locales/`.
- Next steps: wire real OTP, QR generator/scanner, audio recording, and Cardano signing hooks.
